# Shop Management System (Python Project)

This is a small shop billing software created using basic Python programming concepts.  
It allows the user to enter item details and then automatically calculates the total amount.  
The project also saves every bill in a text file with a timestamp.

I made this project for my college subject *Introduction to Problem Solving and Programming*.
